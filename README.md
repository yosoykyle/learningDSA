# learningDSA

This is my personal journey learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** based on **Bro Code's YouTube tutorials**.

## Structure

The project is organized into daily folders like `DAY1_XXXX`, each containing practice files for the day.  
Each folder reflects a dayâ€™s focused DSA practice, with filenames representing specific concepts covered.

## Prerequisite

- Java basics (see [learningJava](https://github.com/yosoykyle/learningJava)).

## Source

Following Bro Code's DSA tutorials on YouTube:

## Goals

- Learn and practice fundamental DSA concepts in Java  
- Build problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills  
- Apply concepts in coding exercises to strengthen understanding  
- Prepare for competitive programming or interviews
